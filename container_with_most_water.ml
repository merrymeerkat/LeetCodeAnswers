(*11. Container With Most Water *)

(*Level: Medium *)

(*Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.*)

(* transforms int list into tuple list. The first element of each tuple is an index, the second is the original int*)
