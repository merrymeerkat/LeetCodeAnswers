# LeetCode

LeetCode does not currently support OCaml, so feel free to look here for a few LeetCode solutions in this language. They seem to work :)

# Kattis

I'm in love with Kattis! The Kattis folder has some solutions to Kattis problems. They are mostly in C++.

If you have any questions about any of the solutions, please feel free to drop me an e-mail me at dani@ffmoura.com :)
